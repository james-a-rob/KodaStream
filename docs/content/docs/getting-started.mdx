## Prerequisites

Before you can begin, make sure your environment is set up with the following software:

1. **Node.js** (LTS version): KodaStream relies on Node.js for the backend server.
2. **FFmpeg**: This tool is required for video encoding and processing.
3. **PostgreSQL**: The database used to store metadata for KodaStream.
4. **Minio**: An object storage service used for media files, stream data, and thumbnails.

---

### Setting Up the Environment

To get started, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   `git clone https://github.com/KodaStream/KodaStream.git`
   
   `cd KodaStream`

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Inside the `KodaStream` directory, run:

   `npm install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

---

### Run Database Migrations

KodaStream uses PostgreSQL to store metadata, so you'll need to run migrations to set up the database schema.

1. **Run migrations:**

   After setting up your database (`kodastream-dev`), run the following command:

   `npm run migrations:run`

This will ensure that all the required tables and relationships are created in your database.

---

### Set Up Minio

Minio is used to manage and store your media files, stream data, and thumbnails.

1. **Run Minio:**

   If you don't have Minio installed, you can run it locally using the following command:

   `minio server /tmp/data`

2. **Create Minio Buckets:**

   You need to create three buckets in Minio to store your data:

   - `kodastream-media` (for media files)
   - `kodastream-stream` (for live stream data)
   - `kodastream-thumbnails` (for storing thumbnails)

You can create these buckets via the Minio web interface or by using the Minio client.

---

### Start the Backend Server

Now that the database and Minio are set up, itâ€™s time to start the backend server.

1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**

   `cd backend`

2. **Start the backend server:**

   Run the following command to start the backend server in development mode:

   `npm run start:dev`

This will start the backend server, which will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

---

### Start the Frontend Server

Once the backend is running, you'll need to start the frontend server to access the user interface.

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

   `cd frontend`

2. **Start the frontend server:**

   Run the following command:

   `npm run dev`

This will start the frontend UI, and it will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

### Access the UI and API

Now that both servers are running, you can access KodaStream through the following:

- **UI**: Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the user interface where you can manage your streams.
- **REST API**: The backend API is available at `http://localhost:4000`. Use this to interact programmatically with your KodaStream instance.
- **Content API**: If you need to manage video content directly, the content API can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully set up KodaStream. You now have a fully functional live streaming platform that you can customize and use for monetization.

In this tutorial, we covered the following steps:

- Setting up the environment (Node.js, FFmpeg, PostgreSQL, and Minio)
- Running database migrations
- Starting the backend and frontend servers
- Accessing the KodaStream UI and API

Now you can start creating and managing live streams, playlists, VODs, and more. Keep an eye on our [roadmap](#roadmap) for upcoming features!

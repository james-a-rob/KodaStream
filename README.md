## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed and running on your system:

1. **Node.js** (LTS version)
2. **FFmpeg**: Required for video processing.
3. **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing metadata.
4. **Minio**: Object storage (for video files, thumbnails, and streams).

### Setup Minio Buckets
- Create three buckets in Minio:
  - `kodastream-media` (for media files)
  - `kodastream-stream` (for live stream data)
  - `kodastream-thumbnails` (for storing thumbnails)

### PostgreSQL Setup
- Create a local database in PostgreSQL called `kodastream-dev`.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. **Set up the Environment**

Ensure you have all required services running (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Minio and FFmpeg) 

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/KodaStream/KodaStream.git
cd KodaStream
npm install

### 3. **Run Database Migrations**

Run the database migrations to set up the necessary schema:

`npm run migrations:run`

### 4. **Start Minio**

Run Minio to create storage buckets:

`minio server /tmp/data`

Ensure Minio is configured with the correct access keys, and that the required buckets (`kodastream-media`, `kodastream-streams`, `kodastream-thumbnails`) exist.

### 5. **Start Backend Server**

Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

`cd backend`

`npm run start:dev`

This will start the backend server, usually on `http://localhost:4000`.

### 6. **Start Frontend**

Navigate to the frontend directory and start the UI:

`cd frontend`

`npm run dev`

The frontend UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 7. **Access the API and UI**

- The **UI** will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
- The **REST API** can be accessed at `http://localhost:4000`.
- The **Content API** is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now interact with the platform via the UI or directly through the API.

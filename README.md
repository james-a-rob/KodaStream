#### Example Request
This example combines two video clips into a looping live stream. As each clip plays, client-side events containing the metadata are triggered. This metadata is used to build out interactivity, such as clickable links and buy buttons.

**POST** `http://localhost:4000/events`

```json
{
    "loop": true,
    "type": "live",
    "scenes": [
        {
            "location": "videos/clip-1.mp4",
            "metadata": {
                "element-type":"link",
                "link-text": "Click me for more info on this camera",
                "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_camera"
            }
        },
        {
            "location": "videos/clip-2.mp4",
            "metadata": {
                "element-type":"link",
                "link-text": "Click me for more info on this ring",
                "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_jewelry"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Playing video
The response of the POST request contains an .m3u8 playlist file in the url field. This file can be loaded into any HLS-compatible player. Each scene's metadata is added as timed metadata. Your HLS player will give you access to this data.

A web-based example of playing a KodaStream interactive video can be found in frontend/demos/simple. Take a look at the KodaPlayer class and its onMetadataChange event to understand more about how client-side interactivity is added.

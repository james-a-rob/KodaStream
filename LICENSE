Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation. It is a modified version of the GNU General Public License (GPL), designed to close the "application service provider" loophole, which allows modified versions of the software to be used over a network without sharing the source code with the users of that service.

The AGPL was created to ensure that users who interact with software over a network (e.g., via a web application) also have access to the software's source code. It is particularly suited for applications deployed as web services.

   a. **Source Code**: You must make the source code available to anyone who receives a copy of the software, either by including the source code with the distribution or by providing a written offer to make it available.

   b. **Modified Versions**: If you modify the software and distribute or use it over a network, you must make the modified source code available to users of the modified version.

2. You must provide a prominent notice stating that you have modified the software and indicating the date of the modification.

3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by the license.

4. When you convey the software, you must include a copy of this license.

5. **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as-is," without any warranty, express or implied. You assume all risks related to using the software.

6. If you use the software in a networked environment, you must ensure that the source code for any modifications is available to the users of the software, and you must make this source code available under the terms of this license.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
